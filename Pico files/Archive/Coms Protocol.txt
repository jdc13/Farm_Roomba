The RPi pico and RPi communicate using I2C. Since the pico 
serves several functions, we need protocol to differentiate 
commands. The address bit of I2C is still needed, however
it is not shown here.

As a rule:
Do not change the 1st byte for any of the commands. If you need a new command, add a number. If we have a command that we don't need
we just won't use that number. We can go up to 255, so it won't be an issue.

1st byte    hardware    command                             following bytes
0           N/A         status request                      [status-from pico to pi] (busy = 1, finished = 0)
1           Arm         harvest                             [which plant to harvest]
2           N/A         Observer update                     [x][y][theta] (May need more bytes per variable. Will need to write code so that values of 0 are ignored.)
3           N/A         Observer status                     [x][y][theta] (from pico to pi. same notes as above command)
4           steppers    wall follow to a specific point     [y coordinate] (x coordinate determined by WF controller)
5           steppers    Drive straight # steps              [# steps][direction]
6           steppers    turn a specific angle               [angle][direction]
