The general idea here is to run the observer and controller for the wall following on the pico.
My reasoning behind this is we are no longer using a live feed from the RealSense camera for navigation.
Most of what we are doing is dead reaconing.
The dead reaconing is much more complicated if it is being done on the raspberry pi, since data has to be sent from 
the pico to the pi then back. If the observer is on the pico we may be able to update it at every step.



Psudo code:

Pi                                                  Pico
Read data from RealSense
use data to map, get location
    Send location to pico -------------------------> update observer
Check if there are bolls to harvest
    if yes: Send which bolls to harvest to pico ---> harvest
        Wait for pico to complete harvesting    <--- harvest complete
    if no: do nothing
Determine next way point
    send coordinates to pico ----------------------> Navigate:
                                                     while observer location not within tolerance of waypoint:
                                                        Run controller based on observer states
                                                        set frequencies on steppers based on controller output
                                                        enable ISR
                                                        check observer (observer updated in ISR)
                                                    
                                                    ISR:
                                                        Run some number of steps
                                                        when done running steps update observer with dead reaconing
                                                    

                                                    After breaking from while loop:
wait for pico to finish navigating <----------------done
State transition
