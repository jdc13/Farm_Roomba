# Potential problems:
# Damping ratio needs to be raised
# rise time needs to be tuned
# maximum angle needs to be lowered.
#Navigation Parameters:
target = 0 #in inches. Will need to convert the camera units

#Controller Parameters:
t = .75 #Rise time (seconds)
z = .707#Damping ratio- The longer period between updating the controller the higher value this needs to be. For very small .707
sigma = 0.05 # Dirty Derivative value

#Saturation Limits:
vmax = 5 #in/s
vmin = 0 #in/s
ThetaMax = np.pi/2 -.2 #because we are using an observer, we can increase our maximum theta
ThetaMin = -1*ThetaMax
Dmax = 2*vmax #difference in speed between the two wheels

L = 12 #Distance between wheels

#_________b0__________
#  s**2 + a1*s + a0
